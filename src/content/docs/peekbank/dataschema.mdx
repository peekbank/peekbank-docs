We developed a common, tidy format for the eye-tracking data in Peekbank to ease the process of conducting cross-dataset analyses.

The schema consists of a set of tables, each tracking different types of information about a given dataset (see below for a list of tables). Each table can be accessed through functions in the <code>peekbankr</code> R package. Table columns are linked through connecting IDs (indicated by links in the schema figure below).

- **datasets**: Information about the eyetracking dataset, including citation info
- **subjects**: Data on individual participants
- **administrations**: Properties of a specific session in which an individual subject participated
- **aoi_timepoints**: Participant looking to the areas of interest (target vs. distractor) sampled at regular time intervals
- **xy_timepoints**: Gaze coordinates of participants' looking to the screen sampled at regular time intervals (if available)
- **trial_types**: Properties of each trial, including the stimuli, target location, and carrier phrase.
- **stimuli**: Stimuli in the form of word-image pairs
- **trials**: A record of the specific order in which a subject completed trials
- **aoi_region_sets**: Positional information about areas of interest (if available)
